Research Experience
----------

**Department of Astronomy, University of Maryland**

* I use a radiative magneto-hydrodynamical code _RAMSES_ to run
  simulations of star cluster formation from molecular clouds using
  supercomputers.
  
* I made minor modifications to the code to investigate various
  dependencies including metallicities, Helium, various feedback
  modules

**Center for Relativistic Astrophysics, Georgia Institute of Technology**

* Created a set of numerical programs to compute the angular
  distribution of X-ray radiation from Low-Mass X-ray Binaries that, for
  the first time, considers random disk shapes.
* The model successfully explains the observed high ratio of reflected
  and direct burst flux, giving implications to unusual accretion disk
  geometry.

**Center for Theoretical Physics; Jilin University**

* Running simulations of CMB anisotropies using CAMB. Learned
  programming in Fortran during the process.

<!-- **My Cool Side Project** -->
<!-- :   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition -->
<!--     list can be used to have named items. -->

<!--     * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the -->
<!--       indentation levels in the markdown source. -->
<!--     * Second item. -->

<!-- Open Source -->
<!-- :   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on -->
<!--     the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you -->
<!--     implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js** -->
<!--     (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally -->
<!--     your idea... -->

<!-- Programming Languages -->
<!-- :   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want -->
<!--     to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to -->
<!--     mention some others together at the end. A format that works well -->
<!--     here is a description list where the first few items have their -->
<!--     first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few -->
<!--     emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf -->
<!--     version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html. -->

<!-- :   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang, -->
<!--     perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url -->
<!--     reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source -->
<!--     file).  -->

<!-- :   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing -->
<!--     it. -->

<!-- :   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp** -->
