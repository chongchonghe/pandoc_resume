Research Experience
----------

2017-Present 
:   **Department of Astronomy, University of Maryland** 

	Advisor: Massimo Ricotti \& Cole Miller (co-advisor)

	* Running simulations of the formation and dynamic evolution of
star clusters in the early universe.  <!-- * Using a radiative
magneto-hydrodynamical code _RAMSES_ to simulate --> <!-- the
formation of star clusters from molecular clouds. -->
  
<!-- * I made minor modifications to the code to investigate various -->
<!--   dependencies including metallicities, Helium, various feedback -->
<!--   modules -->

<!-- * I study the dynamics of star clusters focusing on the effects of -->
<!--   stellar feedback and on the understanding of stellar dynamics. -->

12/2015-03/2016 
:   **Center for Theoretical Physics, Jilin University**

	Advisor: Ping He

	* Ran simulations of CMB anisotropies using _CAMB_.

01/2015-08/2015
:   **Center for Relativistic Astrophysics, Georgia Institute of Technology**

	Advisor: Laurens Keek

	* Created a set of numerical programs to simulate the angular
distributions of X-ray radiation from Low-Mass X-ray Binaries.  <!-- *
Created a set of numerical programs to compute the angular --> <!--
